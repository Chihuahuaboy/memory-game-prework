## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [X] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [X] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [X] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [X] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [X] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [X] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [X] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [X] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
- w3schools

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
A big challenge for me personally throughout my time working on this project would have definitely been figuring out the logic of the game and implementing it into code. I of course knew how the game itself worked, you choose the option that is lit up and do the same for the following patterns. However, implementing such logic in a language I have limited experience on was proving to be rather difficult. Although I knew the basics of creating such a logical statement, not knowing the full spread of tools available to me did not help my situation. I started very simple with just a couple of if and else statements, but the more I tested, the more flaws would be made apparent in my logic. I would even see myself forgetting about certain elements vital to creating the game logic, such as the “progress” variable that had been made to be referenced to the “guessCounter” variable as successive rounds of the game played out. After attempt after attempt for some time, I decided to start studying the example code shown in case of a situation such as mine. Rather than just copy paste however, I made sure I completely understood the code I would be referencing until I knew it was possible for me to recreate the example with correct logic if necessary.


3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
After getting an opportunity at just a taste of what it means to develop a website, I certainly have some questions. One that immediately came to mind was to what lengths must be tread when making even a simple site such as the one I created secure? This also goes with the necessary licensing to ensure that our domain is truly safe and secure for public use. Another question would have to be getting a personal site, or more importantly a business site, open to the public in the first place? The tools used for this project make it seem much more simple, but when using a third-party code editing software, how would one go about transferring all the logic and code into a visibly sound website?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had more time to spare, I would spend much of it trying to make the site itself more appealing. As of now it looks very bland and needs much work for the UI to be both enticing to use and more intuitive. Personally, what makes a good website/game comes a lot from the presentation and the attention to detail in that sense. Apart from that, more ways to play the game is excellent for adding replayability and adds more ways to challenge myself as a developer. For example, difficulty settings and a score system could make for a much more interesting experience when using a site such as the one in the project.
